/* This has been derived from the pure-lv2 plugin. As with JUCE, the idea is
   to make the same plugin binary usable with different kinds of plugin hosts,
   by providing entry points for all supported architectures. The core logic
   of the plugin is factored out as a separate generic base class, so that new
   plugin types can be supported with a minimal amount of additional code.
   Right now it only supports VST, but support for other plugin architectures
   like AU, LV2, Pd etc. (and even JUCE) is planned. */
