   properties, optional properties, extension data, presets, and ports.

   Most of these items are either simple strings or URIs. Presets are given as
   a list of pairs of preset names and URIs. The ports list contains
   descriptions of all ports the plugin provides. Each entry in the ports list
   is a tuple with port number, symbol, name, type (1 = control, 2 = audio,
   3 = CV (control data at audio rate), 4 = atom, 5 = event port, 0 = unknown),
   flags (or'ed together: 1 = input, 2 = output, 4 = midi atom/event port),
   groups, designations, properties, and (in the case of control ports) the
   minimum, maximum and default value and the list of scale points of the
   control.

   Please check the LV2 documentation for information about these elements.
   The essential information is in the name, uri and class fields, and in the
   port descriptions; most notably, port number, symbol, name, type, flags and
   (in the case of control ports) the minimum, maximum and default value, and
   the list of scale points of the control. To make it easier to handle the
   amount of information, we also provide a helper function which just returns
   the essential information (lilv::basic_info); this will contain most things
   needed by a basic LV2 host implementation.

   Please note that this data is for purely informational purposes, it is not
   needed to actually instantiate and run a plugin. Runnable instances of a
   plugin, which can be obtained with lilv::plugin below, provide all the data
   necessary to operate the plugin. */
