This package provides a Pure module for David Robillad's Lilv_, a library for
LV2 plugin host writers. LV2_ is the new Linux audio plugin standard (LADSPA
successor) which aims to be portable and extensible. Lilv makes it possible to
load LV2 plugins in audio and other multimedia software. It is provided as a
comprehensive and well-tested reference implementation for LV2 plugin hosts,
so that authors of multimedia software don't have to craft their own (and
often incomplete or bug-ridden) implementations of the LV2 plugin API.

This module is still under development. When it is finished, it will provide
all the common facilities needed to write LV2 hosts in Pure. We already offer
operations to retrieve information about the LV2 plugins installed on a
system, and to instantiate and run most basic plugins. More work is still
needed in order to support event types such as MIDI and other extensions which
are required to run more advanced plugins.

Documentation still needs to be written. For the time being, please refer to
the lilv.pure script for a description of the programming interface, and to
the scripts in the examples folder for examples showing how to use the
operations provided by this module.
