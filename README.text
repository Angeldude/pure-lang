# The Pure Programming Language

Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term
rewriting. It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full
symbolic rewriting capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation,
lexical closures, built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C
interface. The interpreter uses [LLVM][0] as a backend to JIT-compile Pure
programs to fast native code.

Please check our website at [purelang.bitbucket.org][1] for more information.
Previous releases are available at the old Pure website at [GoogleCode][2].
The Pure Language and Library Documentation is available in [html][3] and
[pdf][4] format. Ubuntu packages for all things Pure can be found at
[Launchpad][5]. Please also check our [mailing list][6] / Google group and
[IRC chat][7] if you need any help or if you want to discuss Pure.

Enjoy. :)
